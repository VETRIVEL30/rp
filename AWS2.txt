EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):

		EC2 is a service provided by AWS that offers resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to create and manage virtual servers, known as instances, to run your applications. Here are some key aspects of EC2:

*Virtual Server: An instance is essentially a virtual server that provides compute capacity in the cloud. It is a self-contained unit with its own operating system, CPU, memory, storage, and network connectivity.

*Elasticity and Scalability: Instances in EC2 are designed to be elastic and scalable. This means you can easily launch new instances or terminate existing ones based on your application's demands, allowing you to quickly scale your compute capacity up or down as needed.

*Instance Types: EC2 provides a variety of instance types optimized for different use cases, such as general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and storage-optimized instances.
	 Each instance type has different combinations of CPU	memory, storage, and networking capacity. Some common instance types include:

	General Purpose: Balanced compute, memory, and networking resources.
	Compute Optimized: High-performance computing with emphasis on CPU power.
	Memory Optimized: High-memory instances for memory-intensive workloads.
	Storage Optimized: High-capacity, high-throughput storage instances.

*Security Groups: Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances. They control inbound and outbound traffic by allowing or denying specific protocols, ports, and IP ranges.

*SSH: Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure network protocol that allows you to establish a secure connection to EC2 instances. SSH is commonly used for remote administration and secure file transfers between your local machine and EC2 instances.

*EC2 Roles: EC2 Roles are IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles that you can assign to EC2 instances. These roles provide temporary security credentials to the instances, allowing them to access AWS services securely without the need for long-term access keys. EC2 roles help in managing permissions and enhancing security.
